# Word/Digit Frequency Analyzer in C
A C-based text analysis program that processes large alphanumeric text files (200,000+ words) to compute detailed statistics about word lengths, starting characters, and digit frequency. This project showcases fundamental systems programming skills including file I/O, argument parsing, array-based counting, and conditional filtering. 

## Features
- Counts total word frequency from an input `.txt` file
- Reports how many words exist for each length (1 to 20+ characters)
